# 1. Accomplishments So Far
- Successfully built core functionalities for the social media platform, including user authentication, post creation, updating, and deletion.
- Database Integration: Configured PostgreSQL as the production database and ensured smooth connection.
- Django REST Framework: Implemented RESTful endpoints for seamless interaction with frontend and third-party services.
- Deployment Preparations: Started configuring production settings, including security enhancements and environment variables management.
- Local Development Setup: Established a virtual environment and installed necessary dependencies.

# 2. Challenges Faced and Solutions
- Missing Dependencies: Faced errors due to missing libraries (e.g., `rest_framework`, `dj_database_url`).
  - *Solution*: Reviewed `requirements.txt` and reinstalled necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Environment Variables Not Recognized**: Encountered issues with setting up `.env` variables.
  - *Solution*: Installed `django-environ`, updated `settings.py` to load environment variables properly, and ensured `.env` was correctly formatted.
- Virtual Environment Activation Issues:
  - *Solution*: Reinstalled the virtual environment, activated it properly using `source .venv/bin/activate` (for Unix) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (for Windows).
- ModuleNotFoundError for Django: Encountered issues running `python manage.py runserver`.
  - *Solution*: Verified Django installation inside the virtual environment and ensured correct Python interpreter selection in VS Code.

# 3. What’s Next? – Plan for the Upcoming Week
- Complete Deployment: Finalize hosting the API on a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean).
- Testing & Debugging: Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
- Performance Optimization: Improve database queries and implement caching strategies.
- Documentation: Enhance API documentation using Swagger or Postman for better usability.

This progress update serves as a checkpoint to track milestones and address pending tasks effectively. Looking forward to a productive week ahead!
